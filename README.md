## strava_running
- Tries getting 99 pages each with 200 activities. (if so many exist)</br>
- Dataset is converted to a Pandas DataFrame and columns are renamed and certain values converted. </br>
- After the cleanup process only a certain amount of columns are taken for the next step (this can be easily changed).</br>
- The cleaned DataFrame is saved to a .csv file.

## get_all_run_walk_activities
- Gets 99 pages each with 200 activities. (if so many exist) </br>
- Only the `Run` and `Walk` activities are taken where the main information is `activity_id` and `summary_polyline` of the map and saved to a csv file. </br>
- Drop some rows that have no meaningful information in them, save the cleaned DFs to new .csv files.

## leaflet_walk.html / leaflet_run.html 
- these 2 files are visualizing the information that is being taken from the .csv files with the help of `app.py` file.

## startup
- To start the Flask instance - run in terminal `python app.py`. </br>
- Open your browser http://127.0.0.1:5001/X , X can be runs or walks. </br>
