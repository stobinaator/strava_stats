## Setup
1. create a virtual env with python version >=3.7.7.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. - either run `jupyter notebook` to run `strava_activities.ipynb`. 
   - or just run `python3 strava_acts.py`
4. run in terminal `python3 app.py` - in order to start the Flask instance
6. open ULR: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/`.

## strava_activities.ipynb
- Getting all available activities from Strava.</br>
- Original raw DataFrame is saved to a .csv file. </br>
- `Run` & `Walk` - Activities are filtered and saved separately for routes visualizations.</br>
- Raw Activities dataset is converted to a Pandas DataFrame and columns are renamed and certain values converted. Data is then ready to be visualized.</br>

## templates/leaflet_*.html 
- `app.py` reads run/walk.csvs, takes polyline information and forwards it to the 2 template files - one for each activity - to visualize them.

## DONE
- [x] Welcome message based on the time of the day. </br>
- [x] Locations drop-down menu with 2 buttons, one for Veliko Tarnovo and one for Karlsruhe. It just saves time dragging from one location to the other, and vice-versa.</br>
- [x] 2 new buttons. Walks/Runs, each one appears next to the drop-down menu. Redirects automatically instead of changing the link manually</br>

## TODO
- [ ] remove the processing part from notebook file and leave only the visualization
- [ ] overlay all run and walk workouts with different colors.
